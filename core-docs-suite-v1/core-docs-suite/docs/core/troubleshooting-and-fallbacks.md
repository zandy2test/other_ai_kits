# Troubleshooting & Fallbacks (fast)

- **Can’t find a workflow?** Run the Startup Checklist steps here as plain text.
- **Tool/capability not available?** Name the tool and error; ask to enable/fix; retry once; propose a minimal fallback; record skipped items.
- **UI proof without images?** Use assertions by role/text/label; capture console/logs or DOM/text.
- **Too much process?** Keep to single‑screen pages; split only when necessary.
