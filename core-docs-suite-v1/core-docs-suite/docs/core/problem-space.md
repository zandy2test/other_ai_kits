# Problem Space & Scope

**Objective**: Ship changes with reliable verification and clear communication, using light‑weight rules and workflows.

**In scope**
- Rules that prevent silent failure and ambiguity.
- A verification standard that works without special tooling or screenshots.
- Minimal, actionable documents that any AI/human can follow.

**Out of scope**
- Vendor‑specific UI instructions.
- Heavy process that slows iteration.

**Constraints & assumptions**
- Prefer accessibility semantics (roles/labels/text) for UI assertions.
- Keep PRs small and reversible; summarize diffs; record risks/asks.
