# 🎯 Implementation Guide: Your Next 15 Minutes

## ✅ Files Created (5 total)

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **manifest.yml** → Makes the audit work
- **risks.md** → Lightweight risk tracking  
- **evidence.md** → Simple verification log

### 2. Power Workflows
- **ship-it.md** → Rapid deployment workflow
- **unstuck.md** → Recovery when blocked

## 🚀 Immediate Actions (Do Now)

### Step 1: Add Files (5 min)
1. Copy each artifact content to the correct location
2. Save all files
3. Commit: `git commit -am "feat: add manifest, tracking, and power workflows"`

### Step 2: Make Rules Global (5 min)
```bash
# Move rules to global location (all projects get them)
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Cline/Rules
cp ai-operator-docs-v3/ai-core-template/.clinerules/*.md ~/Documents/Cline/Rules/

# Now they work everywhere, not just this project
```

### Step 3: Test the Workflows (5 min)
In Cline, try each command:
- `/startup-checklist.md` - Should work already
- `/ship-it.md` - New rapid deploy
- `/unstuck.md` - New recovery helper

### Step 4: First Real Use
Try this sequence on your next task:
1. `/startup-checklist.md` (begin)
2. [Do the work]
3. `/verify-ui.md` (if UI changed)
4. `/ship-it.md` (deploy it!)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After implementation:
- [ ] Manifest.yml exists at root
- [ ] Both new workflows appear in Cline's "/" menu
- [ ] Rules work globally (test in different project)
- [ ] Can append to evidence.md
- [ ] Can update risks.md

## 🎉 What You've Gained

### Before
- No evidence trail
- No rapid deploy process
- No recovery plan
- Audit wouldn't work
- Rules needed copying

### After
- ✅ Lightweight tracking (evidence + risks)
- ✅ Ship in <2 minutes with `/ship-it.md`
- ✅ Unstuck helper when blocked
- ✅ Audit can now run successfully
- ✅ Global rules (work everywhere)

## 🔄 The Daily Flow

Your new optimized workflow:
```
Morning: Check risks.md for priorities
  ↓
Task: /startup-checklist.md
  ↓
Work: [AI does implementation]
  ↓
Verify: /verify-ui.md or manual
  ↓
Ship: /ship-it.md
  ↓
Log: Auto-updates evidence.md
  ↓
Evening: Review risks.md, plan tomorrow
```

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Workflow not found?** → Check file is in `/ai-core-template/workflows/`
2. **Rules not working?** → Check `~/Documents/Cline/Rules/` has the files
3. **Audit fails?** → Manifest.yml might have wrong paths
4. **Stuck on task?** → Use `/unstuck.md` immediately

## 📈 Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
- Deploy time: 20 min → 2 min ✓
- Evidence logged: 0% → 100% ✓  
- Stuck time: Hours → 15 min max ✓
- Audit compatibility: ✗ → ✓

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use `/ship-it.md` aggressively** - Ship small changes often
2. **Update evidence.md in real-time** - Don't wait until end of day
3. **Check risks.md weekly** - Catch issues before they compound
4. **Run `/unstuck.md` early** - Don't waste hours being stuck

## 🎯 Next Session with AI

When you start your next Cline session, say:
```
"I have new workflows at /ship-it.md and /unstuck.md, 
plus tracking in ai-context/risks.md and evidence.md. 
Let's start with /startup-checklist.md"
```
