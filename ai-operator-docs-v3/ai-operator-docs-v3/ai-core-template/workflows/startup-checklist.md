# Startup checklist (run with `/startup-checklist.md`)
1) Inventory MCP tools (Playwright, Firecrawl). If Not connected → ask to enable → retry once.
2) Pull live context: @problems → @terminal → @git-changes → targeted @/file.
3) Confirm repo save behavior (autosave + code actions).
4) Define acceptance checks (done‑when).
5) Verify‑first: tests; if Playwright MCP connected, assert via roles/text; else ask → retry → fallback.
6) Report: plan → diff summary → verification results → risks/asks.
