# Glossary
- **Assertion**: A check that confirms expected behavior (UI by role/text/label; non‑UI by data/logs).
- **Evidence**: One additional artefact (trace/logs/DOM text) supporting assertions.
- **Capability**: A tool or permission that enables an action (e.g., UI introspection).
- **Fallback**: The safest reduced‑scope action when a capability is unavailable.
