# System Overview (Annex)

**Why this structure**  
- **Diátaxis**: single‑purpose pages (tutorial/how‑to/reference/explanation) reduce confusion and drift.  
- **Docs‑as‑Code**: docs live in git, reviewed by PR like code.

**Operating model**  
- Small rules/workflows that prevent silent failure and guide verification.  
- Tool‑agnostic verification via accessibility semantics (roles, labels, text).
