# Exec Brief (tool‑agnostic)

**What this is**  
A small, durable kit for safe, repeatable work: verify‑first, fail‑loudly, minimal ceremony.

**How to start**
1) Copy this `/docs` folder into your repo.
2) Read `rules-and-workflows.md` and run the **Startup Checklist** (as plain text steps).
3) For UI‑affecting changes, apply `verification-standard.md` before calling “done.”

**Evidence bar (flexible)**
- ✅ Assertions by **role/text/label** (accessibility‑first) on the affected surface, **plus one of**: a short trace, relevant logs, or DOM/text capture.
- ✅ 3–6 bullet diff summary and any risks/asks.

**Why this shape?**  
Single‑purpose pages (Diátaxis) + docs in git (Docs‑as‑Code) keep things clear and easy to maintain.
